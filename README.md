# Exercise: default methods override
* define a `it.develhope.override.Smartphone` class that implements `Cloneable` and has:
  * 5 attributes:
    * a string `brandName`
    * a string `modelName`
    * an int `batterymAh`
    * an attribute `producerPrice` of type `SmartphonePrice`
    * an attribute `retailPrice` of type `SmartphonePrice`
  * [using IntelliJ] an override of the `toString()` method in order to print all the attributes of a `it.develhope.override.Smartphone` object
  * [using IntelliJ] an override of the `equals()` method that check all the 5 attributes to establish if two `it.develhope.override.Smartphone` objects are equal
  * [using IntelliJ] an override of the `hashCode()`, using all the 5 attributes
  * [using IntelliJ] an override of the `clone()` method (that will have to be `public`) where:
    * a `clonedSmartphone` is generated using `super.clone()`
    * there's an assignment to the `clonedSmartphone.producerPrice`
    * there's an assignment to the `clonedSmartphone.retailPrice`
    * the return value is a `it.develhope.override.Smartphone` object
  * a constructor method that accepts 5 params (`brand`, `model`, `battery`, `prodP`, `retailP`) and assign the right values to the object
* define a `SmartphonePrice` class that implements `Cloneable` and has:
  * 2 attributes:
    * a string `priceType`
    * a double `priceInEuros`
  * [using IntelliJ] an override of the `clone()` method (that will have to be `public`) where:
    * a `clonedSmartphonePrice` is generated using `super.clone()`
    * the return value is a `SmartphonePrice` object
  * [using IntelliJ] an override of the `toString()` method for returning an informative `String` about the 2 `SmartphonePrice` attributes
  * [using IntelliJ] an override of the `equals()` method that check the 2 attributes to establish if two `SmartphonePrice` objects are equal
  * [using IntelliJ] an override of the `hashCode()`, using the 2 attributes
  * a constructor method that accepts 2 params (`type`, `price`) and assign the right values to the object
* define a tester class with `main()` method where you:
  * create 4 new `SmartphonePrice` objects: 2 for `Producer` and 2 for `Retail`
  * create 2 new `it.develhope.override.Smartphone` objects, using the 4 newly created `SmartphonePrice` objects
  * print in console all the details of the 2 newly created `it.develhope.override.Smartphone` objects
  * check if the first smartphone is equal to the second smartphone, informing the user
  * use a `try{ ... } catch(Exception exception) { ... }` to:
    * get a new `it.develhope.override.Smartphone` object by cloning the second `it.develhope.override.Smartphone`
    * print in console all the details of the newly cloned object
    * check if the second smartphone is equal to the newly cloned object, informing the user
    * inside the `catch(Exception exception) { ... } ` scope:
      * print the [stack trace](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Throwable.html#printStackTrace()) of the exception
      * inform the user about the error
